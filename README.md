### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Amena. The top 3 things I love are Teaching, Coding, Cooking.<br/>
I keep exploring new courses online and implement what I learn.
I am also interested in Robotics, AI-ML, Data Science, Web Development and Digital Marketing.

Things I tell myself to stay motivated:
- Give Yourself Time. Take time to learn new things.
- Be patient. During learning, you may hit roadblocks. Try to overcome them. If you can't solve it in one go, just take a small break.
- Be regular. Do not procrastinate.
